This file contains the flow monitor conventions used by libcfruby.  Since 
the FlowMonitor library used by libcfruby for logging and message passing 
attempts to be usage agnostic, a system of messages and tags must be agreed 
upon for it to have the maximum use.

libcfruby uses the basic conventions implemented as helper functions in the 
FlowMonitor library, meaning that the following message types are used:

intention - Used to indicate that the message indicates something that the 
library is about to do, but hasn't yet.  Any observer may respond with 
false to prevent the action from taking place.

exception - Used to indicate that an exception has been raised

info, warn, debug - Used to implement standard logging.

In addition the following tags are attached to messages (mostly 
intentions) to aid observers in making decisions:

nonreversible - The action cannot be reversed (e.g. a file deletion)
destructive - The action writes something to a filesystem (e.g. a file backup)
unknown - The action has potentially far-reaching and unknown consequences, 
	but may also have none.  Mostly used to mark when an external script is 
	to be run.
exec - The action is the running of a user-provided executable command
install - The action is the installation of a program
