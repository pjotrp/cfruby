- Add Tutorial section on extending Cfruby
- Package Cfenjin in Nix

== BUGS

- copy function does not complain when the original file does not
	exist
- When overwriting a symbolic link cfenjin should notify rather than
	stop executing

== FEATURES

- print shellcommands
- fix cfruby removes root dir
x fix cfruby copy permissions
. Add onchanged 
. stop services like cupsys, portmap, squid, inetd, nfs-kernel-server 
. Debian support for update-rc.d -f exim4 remove 
. upgrade some packages automatically (ssh, bind, postfix, clamav, spama)

== Pjotr's Section (regarding the Cfruby parser):

Finalize before 1.0:

- Handle --strict consistently

	The --strict option has cfenjin fail when a file can not be copied,
	a link can not be created etc.
	
- Document all methods

	Full rdoc

- Generate all supported attributes

Notes:

- allow for dash in user/group name (improve logic)

x test cfruby copy standard uid=0?
  mkdir, copy should take user=root?

Old TODO List:

Cfruby Parser:

x unit tests for exec escaping
x Build source code tree
x eval code snippet
x Catch exceptions of 'eval script' in cfp_execute.rb
x Expand script into full Ruby class
x file: action
x link: action
x Handle classes (add item to class)
x Handle class rules (rule:: syntax)
x dir: action
x editfiles: action
x shell: action
x Implement package rules
x only copy when file changed
- Support non-sequential action sequences
- speedup copy on file change by checking size and ctime first

  Cfruby first edition covered at this point!

x Localise $ variables with @cf.site Hash
x Encapsulate @cf class passed to scripts
x Change global classlist in Cfruby to cfp_stat member
x Handle syntax errors in scripts with clear messages
x Provide simple execute call through library method
- Role support
- Give Cfengine coverage for all commands
x Write unit test for single parsed scripts (like cfsshd.rb)
- Refactor visible methods in cfrubyruntime.rb
+ Merge cfrubylib's editfile implementation
